# Simple-tasker
html & javascript webapp to record tasks. Stores data locally in your browser.

## Demo
(you can use any-subdomain.nugs.io )
- http://work-tasker.nugs.io
- http://weekend-tasker.nugs.io

## Setup
- copy the background image and index.html to an internet-accessible web server
- simple-tasker is best used with DNS wildcards (each subdomain will have a different task list due to the nature of localStorage)

## Usage
- Enter a task
- Check it off when it's done
- Delete the task and refresh the page to see it go away
